# Sports de chambres
 Dating app for athletes, developped as the final year project of my second year at EFREI Paris. 
The goal of the app is for athletes to meet and interact with each other.
The web-app includes a swipe mechanic to match with someone you're interested in and a chat.
All the data from the app concerning the profiles and the chats are stored remotely on a cloud hosted by MongDB


# Launch React App :
